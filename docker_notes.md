# Docker Notes

Docker is for running application environments inside containers, somewhat like VMs, but more dependent on the OS and more lightweight and flexible.

## Usage

`docker [option] [command] [arguments]`

`docker docker-subcommand --help`

**Example:  Publish an Nginx server container**

`docker container run -it -p 80:80 nginx`

â€‹	Create a container interactively (as opposed to in the background) (-it) and publish it (-p) on local machine port 80 (80:) using the container's port 80 (80), using nginx web server.  The first 80 could be anything in terms of your local ports but the second should be 80 for nginx.
